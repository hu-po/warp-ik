**Evo**lutionary Code generation for **ARC**-AGI Kaggle Challenge

## Abstract

uses an agent (e.g. claude sonnet, gpt 4o, etc) to rewrite the model and training pipeline for a deep-learning notebook solution to the arc-agi 2024 kaggle challenge. solutions, called `morphs` are run in docker containers and compete to get the highest eval accuracy. a basic evolutionary algorithm with mutation and selection improves the morphs over time.

various types of compute were used

- `ojo` - a local nvidia agx orin
- `oop` - a local linux pc with nvidia 3090
- `big` - a cloud instance with 1xH100
- `kag` - a cloud kaggle nb with 4xT4

## Setup

first ssh into your machine and setup the environment (must have docker installed)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hu-po/evoarc
pip install nbformat arxiv wandb
export WANDB_API_KEY=...
```

depending on what models you want to use as the agent, setup your keys:

```bash
pip install replicate
export REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=...
pip install openai 
export OPENAI_API_KEY=...
pip install anthropic
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...
```

## Usage

run the morph `foo` locally on `oop`:

```bash
./scripts/test.sh oop foo
```

start the evolutionary process using `foo` as the protomorph:

```bash
python3 evolve.py --seed 42 --compute_backend oop --protomorphs foo
```

mutate a single morph:

```bash
python3 mutate.py --morph foo
```

clean out the output directory:

```bash
./scripts/clean.sh
```

to submit a morph to kaggle you need to "create a notebook" from the ["code" page](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/arc-prize-2024/code) and paste in the code for your morph from `output/foo/export.ipynb`. then click "save version" and make sure to disable internet. then go to the ["submit" page](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/arc-prize-2024/submit) and hit "submit prediction".
