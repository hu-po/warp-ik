class Morph(BaseMorph):
    """
    Inverse Kinematics Morph using Sampling-based Jacobian Estimation with Gauss-Newton update.

    This novel IK solver estimates the local Jacobian via random sampling in joint space.
    For each environment, a set of small random perturbations are applied to the current joint configuration.
    The resulting changes in the 6D end‐effector error are collected, and a least-squares regression is used 
    to estimate the local Jacobian. A damped Gauss–Newton update is then computed by solving
      (J·Jᵀ + λI) y = error_base    and    Δq = -Jᵀ y,
    and the joint angles are updated accordingly. This approach is distinct from the standard finite-difference 
    or Jacobian-transpose methods.

    Note: This algorithm samples multiple perturbations per environment. Although the sampling loop is conducted on 
    the CPU in Python, most heavy lifting (error computation and joint updates) leverages Warp's GPU-accelerated kernels.

        Performs one IK step using a sampling-based estimation of the Jacobian and a Gauss–Newton update.

        For each environment:
          1. The current end-effector error vector (6D) is computed.
          2. A set of random joint-space perturbations (drawn from a Gaussian with standard deviation sigma)
             is generated.
          3. For each perturbation, the joint configuration is altered for that environment,
             and the resulting change in end-effector error is recorded.
          4. Using least-squares regression, a local Jacobian matrix J (6 x dof) is estimated so that
             Δ_error ≈ J · perturbation.
          5. The damped Gauss–Newton update is computed by solving:

          6. The joint configuration is updated by adding Δq.
